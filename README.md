# TDD in Legacy Code Transformation

## Context & Purpose

I found [Valentina](https://github.com/valentinacs/valentina) sharing her thoughts & process on how we can transform legacy codebase into a testable one. And eventually use TDD to gain confidence in software delivery

She is writing a series of articles at [Optivem](https://journal.optivem.com/) which will guide the readers through the entire process.

The purpose is to learn that process.

## Todo App

We will create a todo app. This project will have two repositories

1. Vue Frontend
2. Node/Express Backend

Check [Project Board](https://github.com/users/naumanzchaudhry/projects/2) for tickets
